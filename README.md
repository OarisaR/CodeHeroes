# CodeHeroes

CodeHeroes is a gamified coding quiz platform designed to help users master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through interactive challenges and quests. Itâ€™s an engaging way to enhance your coding skills, test your knowledge, and prepare for coding interviews and competitions.

## Features

### Quest Mode
Embark on thematic coding quests that guide you through a variety of DSA topics. Each quest contains progressively harder challenges to test your problem-solving abilities.

### Arena
Engage in random coding challenges that help you practice problem-solving on the go. Perfect for sharpening your skills in a timed, pressure-filled environment.

### Topic Filters
Filter coding challenges by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Graphs) to focus on specific areas of DSA that need improvement.

### Library
A collection of resources, explanations, and study material to help you better understand key DSA concepts at your own pace.

### Timed Battles
Challenge yourself or others in timed coding battles that simulate real-world competitive coding scenarios.

### Hall of Fame
A leaderboard featuring top coders, allowing you to see how you rank and providing motivation to improve.
